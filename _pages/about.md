I have written this basic functionality a half-dozen times and figured it was about time I generalize and re-use, also about time I take into consideration actual running time of functions. Maybe I am way out to lunch :sleeping:, call me out or help improve the idea.

This is also my first OSS project, after an embarassing number of started / half-finished and abandonded projects over the last decade I decided to do something dead-simple that I had no reason not to complete. At the very least I hope to learn the ropes of OSS and gain some motivation to finish other personal projects.
